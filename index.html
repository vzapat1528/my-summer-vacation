<h1>My Summer Vacation</h1>

<h2>June</h2>

<p>In <b>June it was my birthday</b> but this year we decided to not do anything big so instead my friends and I went to <a href="http://www.gravitopia.us/">Gravitopia</a> which is a trampoline park.That was pretty fun another thing that I did in June was that I had to go to this youth police camp in Mauldin, which is pretty fun even though the officers can be kind of strict. It was my second year there and I really enjoyed it. That was basically it for June.</p>

<h2>July</h2> 

<p>In July I finished my Police camp thing, so all of my friends and I decided to go to Frankies and hang out in celebration of our graduation. For the Fourth of July my bestfriend went to <a href="https://www.nycgo.com/">New York</a> with me which was so much fun, this was the first time that my friend had been to New York so it was great to be with her there. My friend decided to invite me to her house for the weekend to have a sleepover and I told her that I couldn't go which made her really sad. The thing was that I was just tricking her so she would think that I wasn't going but then I would be able to surprise her, my plan did work.</p>

<h2>August</h2>

<p>Last but not least August! Now in August I had my friends birthday and she has this really big ranch so all of my friends went over there to celebrate her birthday and to watch the eclipse. On her birthday we did a lot of fun and cool stuff like ride on four-wheelers and ride on the horse. Another thing that we did was play with water balloons and the hose. Now the day of the ecplise was really cool we all took pictures and videos and all of that fun stuff. I had the worst of luck that day though, I had unfortunatly not have my solar eclipse glasses which was sad so I just shared with other people.</p>
